# Welcome to the SRTP Project Collaboration Platform

This is a collaborative platform designed for the SRTP (Student Research Training Program) project. In this repository, users can upload their Python codes and share study materials. You are encouraged to freely update your PyTorch code and other content to contribute to the projectâ€™s progress.

## Repository Structure
Our repository is currently organized into two main sections:
- **Code**: A space for Python codes, including those built with PyTorch and reinforcement learning algorithms.
- **Academic Materials**: A collection of study resources, such as research papers and learning materials, to support the project.

## Project Purpose
The goal of this SRTP project is to optimize power integrity by incorporating decoupling capacitors through reinforcement learning algorithms. This initiative combines both learning and coding efforts to achieve innovative solutions in power management.

## Join the Collaboration
We invite you to actively participate by:
- Uploading your Python codes and PyTorch implementations.
- Sharing valuable study materials with the community.
- Regularly updating your contributions to keep the repository dynamic and relevant.

Start collaborating today and help us advance this exciting SRTP project!
